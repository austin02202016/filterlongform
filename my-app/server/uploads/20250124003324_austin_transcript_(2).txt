Interviewer
Yeah.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah, it's recording. That's gonna be the first chunk.
Austin Kennedy
An.
Interviewer
Hour and get everything done. That'd be huge. Let me just DM this girl I was. I love. Wait, I wanted to look at her Instagram. Okay, good.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah. The big thing is, like, whatever you ask, envision it how it would end up turning.
Interviewer
Let me also, like, whether that's a story, whether that would be thoughts or. Actually, I have a questions list. They're like, really unique questions. It wouldn't be like, stories.
Austin Kennedy
Would she ask or, I don't know, the contest.
Interviewer
Yeah, I'm gonna go to my notes page. What should I say to this girl? She's in my. My zoom on philosophy. And then I was like, oh, I think you're in my zoom. Like, philosophy zoom.
Austin Kennedy
What are you trying to do?
Interviewer
Human network platform. I thought that was really cool. Maybe we study together as. As exams approach or could just get coffee. I don't fucking know. I'm out of loop on some of this.
Austin Kennedy
Wait, did you rip that in the LinkedIn DMs?
Interviewer
She's cool. I'm trying to just be friends right now.
Austin Kennedy
I want to do that. Yet. I would start a little bit.
Interviewer
I'm not going all in.
Austin Kennedy
I know you're not weird. Like, have.
Interviewer
Yes. I'm literally about to send it. Maybe we can study other as exams approach or just get coffee.
Austin Kennedy
I wouldn't leave it at that.
Austin Kennedy
I. I would. I would ask a semi, like a question.
Interviewer
Oh, so you're saying. Oh, I'm definitely.
Austin Kennedy
And then have.
Interviewer
Like, I think you're in my fellow exam. Lol. And I saw you.
Austin Kennedy
I don't know, the cognice.
Austin Kennedy
Leave it at like, the.
Austin Kennedy
The coffee.
Interviewer
It's like, why are you. I don't know.
Austin Kennedy
I don't know. I mean, it don't. It kind of seems. Yes, yes, yes. Well, I mean, what. Okay, you're like. It seems.
Interviewer
Have.
Austin Kennedy
Have.
Austin Kennedy
It makes sense that you're like, why you're asking.
Interviewer
Wait, should I be like, what's this human network thing all about? Wait, that's like.
Austin Kennedy
Wait. Okay, okay, okay. What would I do?
Interviewer
It seems cool. What's this human networking all about? It seems cool.
Austin Kennedy
Wait, let me think of what I did for Monisa. Well, no, the way it worked was I was like, oh, we should, like, talk about your business in person more at some point. Like, something along those lines. So if I got a Muslim, the. Well, yeah, as a. You know, if I. If I worked with a Muslim girl, then, you know, I didn't slide in the LinkedIn DMs though I matter.
Interviewer
You should talk about your business in person.
Austin Kennedy
I. I Lowkey would just say what's this human network thing all about? But make it seem like you're talking from a place of curiosity, not like LinkedIn DMs you're trying to seem.
Interviewer
But I've always wanted to do this. I've done it.
Austin Kennedy
You know what I mean?
Interviewer
I'm going with.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah, yeah, it. I mean, honestly, if she's like mildly cool, like she'll. It's easy. You know what I mean?
Interviewer
This human network thing seems.
Austin Kennedy
And also if she reads your bio, your thing says CIA for entrepreneurship.
Interviewer
Dude.
Austin Kennedy
She's definitely.
Interviewer
She accepted my request. Yeah. Building the CI. She thinks I'm the like the kookiest person alive. Or it's like damn, he's dope.
Austin Kennedy
Well I mean bro, who says that?
Interviewer
Imagine.
Austin Kennedy
I mean you're.
Austin Kennedy
You're definitely showing your true and then.
Interviewer
Asking to grow on a date in the CIA for entrepreneurs. Like get the out of my dms, bro. Absurd.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah.
Austin Kennedy
That's what me and. That's what me and what's her face.
Interviewer
Yeah. You look at my LinkedIn, that's my true color. That's for sure.
Austin Kennedy
Mia.
Interviewer
Shitting on entrepreneur communities.
Austin Kennedy
How different I would seem if you look at my Instagram versus my LinkedIn. I look like a complete like. Not necessarily, but you get a vibe of a completely different person. That was going to be hella fraternal and I mean, I guess I kind of am, but. Well, I'm packaged very fraternal, but my product is very founder ish base. Yeah dude, your wi fi is ass.
Interviewer
It's funny.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah Tommy, your. Your wi fi is ass broke it.
Interviewer
No, I just. I just went to hotspot. I've been. I'm hoping this works better. All right, let me go quick new tab. Oh, this is a little quicker dope. Okay. Yeah you dude, I think. I think I don't know why I keep getting logged out of chat GPT. It's kind of getting annoying. My notes page that's in there. Interesting questions. I think I have test and then.
Austin Kennedy
Especially ask about again experiences too as like one you could ask me to like retrieve something from my memory but if it's also just like tell me about how like tell me about how you donate plasma. Why would you do that? Like. Like that, you know.
Interviewer
Yeah. All right, here we go. Here's a few. He's a little more abstract. We'll see if it like fits with some of these combos. This is not a bad one. Okay, ready?
Austin Kennedy
Yep. All right, let's rip it.
Interviewer
Curious. Like what you think maybe in the past year or so has been maybe a new belief, behavior or habit that's really been improving life?
Austin Kennedy
I think that new habit would be exactly what we were just talking about where I used to think that work life balance was just on a day to day of like, oh, I need to wake up today, I need to work for six hours, I need to go to the gym, I need to play a little pickup basketball. My friends, I need to hang out with my friends and I always try to pile that into one day. But a big difference lately has been doing work life balance on seasons. So maybe this semester it's just all work, a little bit of lifting and maybe I'm not spending as much time with friends, but that's okay because next semester it's going to be leaning back into the college experience, a little bit of context and going on gap this semester. And a big reason for that is so that this semester I could just go all into work and then next semester it'll be, oh, I'm going to sit back, I'm going to enjoy myself a little bit more and then I'll be able to appreciate that more and lean into that more. So I just think that work life balance should be more on a seasonal basis rather than a day to day basis. So that's probably like the new framework and consequently habit that I've changed in the last year.
Interviewer
Is there some sort of analogy that you usually point towards with this work life balance? Like I've seen some with, with the stock market or others in terms of not having any, any work for a period of time. And then the same goes for life.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah, I don't really have like an analogy to it. Like, I mean, I know you do, but like for me it's. I don't really have like a framework in which I really think of it through question. But I guess actually I'll share one thing though. One thing that I used to think about was I would always get so mad when I got a little bit worse at basketball. Like let's say I would be really locking in on scaling my podcast proof of concept in that time. I would just be dedicating so much time and then I would get, I'd go play basketball with my friends and I'd feel and I'd be worse. I'd be like, dude, what the fuck? Now I need to go practice basketball for days to get better. And I never accepted that I Can't do it all at the same time. That was one thing that I was really hard to accept. But once I realized, hey, you know, I'm going to get works at basketball for a year maybe, but then I can lean back into it later and then just identifying that I could have it all, just not at the same time.
Interviewer
Yeah, yeah. What's a story that you don't often share with people? Maybe one that you don't normally get to something that you're very, very proud of, but you don't get the opportunity to actually share it with most. Maybe it's kind of one of these hidden stories, hidden adventure.
Austin Kennedy
I would probably say the biggest thing that's shaped me was if we go back two summers, I go into the summer. I didn't really have anything to do. I was working at Mariano. I was a frozen. I managed the frozen apartment there. And that was very hard work, very physically hard work. So what I ended up doing was I'm walking home one day, I come across a friend that's got his lanyard on going door to door. I'm like, hey, bro, like, what are you doing? And he's like, oh, like, you know, I do door to sales for the solar company. I'm like, oh, so you know, like asking me, give him my pitch, give me the pitch. And then I dab him up and we're walking away. He's like, hey, dude, you want to, you want to join? Because I could hook you up with this and you could start this week. I could just text my manager. I'm like, you know, cool. I'll think about it, you know, walk home, think about it for a few days. Texting me, I'm like, you know, maybe I am interested in that. And one thing led to another. I drive an hour and a half out to Tinley park, have the meeting, and then all of a sudden I'm in door to door sales. And right now I'm back in the VC startup space. But that taught me how to be scrappy so much because these kids are just working so hard in its effort that I didn't see at school. And I think that was a big difference that I really took because at school, like, you have this pride attached to you, right? But then my freshman year, I had this pride of like, oh, I'm a college kid. Like, I don't need to be doing those things. But getting back on the doors, like, really took me back down to like, oh, I'm not shit. Or like, I'm no different than anybody else. I'm not better because I go to this college that's like, pretty good. And I think it was just that ongoing experience that really humbled me and taught me a lot of skills that I took with me for life.
Interviewer
Totally.
Austin Kennedy
I got cursed out at so many doors.
Austin Kennedy
It was.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah, it was not fun. I'm like, dude, I'm nice, bro. Like, trust. Like, I probably go to the college a kid wants to go to, I guess.
Interviewer
What'S, what's like, if I give you. If I give you this billboard in Times Square, it's kind of this message being put on this blank piece of real estate. Would you say, is there any been any, like, life thesis that you try to live by day to day? Or I guess that's even a part two part question. We'll leave that one for later.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah, maybe.
Interviewer
Is this, like, message you want to share with tens of millions Americans?
Austin Kennedy
There's a, There's a TED Talk.
Interviewer
It could be a. It could be an image. It could be whatever you want to put on a billboard.
Austin Kennedy
I think if there's one thing that.
Austin Kennedy
People need to hear, it would take me back to. There's this TED Talk by Jack O'Willink, for those of you guys don't know. I think he's a Navy seal, army arranger, very very accomplished veteran. And the TED Talk is about extreme ownership and very, very, very new TED Talk. And the whole thesis of it is sometimes it's not necessarily good to believe facts, but it's better to just believe everything is your fault. Because when you do this, it puts yourself in a position of responsibility and consequently power. Because if you can control or if you believe that you can control everything, then everything that happens to you is your fault. And you can then have. And you can then have control over it.
Austin Kennedy
And like, that's something that I think.
Austin Kennedy
A lot of people need to hear more is like, even my old self, I always used to take a victim mentality. And I think a lot of people just need to know that they're in control of their lives and that they could consequently. Angel.
Interviewer
Sure. What is that life thesis you're living day to day by? Is there anything that kind of keeps you in, Keeps you in touch with reality? Any sort of common thesis throughout life?
Austin Kennedy
I'll just say those two words, my fault.
Interviewer
Elaborate a little bit.
Austin Kennedy
Let me see if I can give.
Interviewer
A story doesn't have to be a story. Don't force it into a story. Not everybody's gonna think of that.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah, well, what do you mean by. Elaborate on it.
Interviewer
Your life thesis is my fault. So what does that mean?
Austin Kennedy
Just whenever anything occurs, whether it's good or bad, that is my fault. So if I, like, put myself in a position that this extremely lucky thing occurs to me, like, cool, is my fault, but if something extremely bad happens to me, it's my fault. And. Is that what you were implying?
Interviewer
That's wonderful. Yeah, it's a great explanation.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah, I.
Austin Kennedy
That's just a framework that I've adopted that helps me a lot because when I'm always pointing the finger in, that means that I'm always controlling it. I'm always in control.
Interviewer
Sure. What?
Austin Kennedy
Also, I know we started at like, 10 minutes.
Interviewer
You started at what?
Austin Kennedy
10 minutes.
Interviewer
So this is 10 minutes? Yeah.
Austin Kennedy
No, no, no. We're only six minutes in because.
Interviewer
Oh, I got nine minutes on my side, so.
Austin Kennedy
Oh, okay. Okay. I guess it is time to stop. Okay, cool.
Interviewer
Curious. Do you want to switch at 15 or.
Austin Kennedy
No, I think we should just go full in on the simulation. We could do you. They could do you, like, tomorrow if you want.
Interviewer
It's not that. It's not even for me. I don't know if I'll be. Dude. Okay, well, ask me about specific experiences.
Austin Kennedy
That, you know, I have, but I'm not going to have. I mean, you could go through their LinkedIn, bro. Like, you could find stuff about them.
Interviewer
Okay, yeah, I get what you're saying.
Austin Kennedy
And you can relate it.
Interviewer
Okay.
Austin Kennedy
Or like, what was the biggest problems?
Interviewer
I'm gonna talk more about your week, that's for sure. But after this question, my question being whether it was made with money, time, or energy, what was like, the most worthwhile investment, maybe in the past month or so? Is there anything that you invested time into, money into, or energy that has really paid off?
Austin Kennedy
Last week I spent a week in Silicon Valley and I obviously had to front the money of being out there, as well as a whole week of pretty much not being able to do stuff, not being able to go to the gym. And it was very well worth it just because the people that we met, whether it was people like Thomas, Tom Siebel, as well as a bunch of other very, very accomplished startups that are UIDC grads, just the amount of spontaneous luck that can occur from putting myself in that position was well worth the cost.
Interviewer
What, what's today? Thursday? Yeah. Okay. Break down like a day in the life of Austin. One of these. One of these past days on, like, Tuesday, Wednesday maybe. Something that's kind of very normal and kind of what happens day to day.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah. So I mean, we could take any of these last three days. I woke up, I went downstairs, I showered, I put a bagel in my microwave, I went upstairs, put on clothes. Well, that. Well, that bagel was microwaving. And then I come back down with my backpack on, grab the bagel, I drive to work. I get here, I open my laptop. That laptop doesn't shut for 13 hours. And I just work and work. I go get Chipotle in the middle of the day. When I get Chipotle, I'm watching videos about how I can improve my work, and I end up driving home around midnight. That's when my spy hero ends up. And then I get home and I go to bed and I do it all over again.
Interviewer
What kind of work does this entail? Mail stripper worker.
Austin Kennedy
Okay. Lately I've been building applications that can aid in my copywriting processes. And I guess what those look like is like, right now I'm building a product called Write Like Them, where you can input any. Txt, any text file, any reel, or any short video. Choose who you want to write like, and you can do a little bit of adjusting on the prompt and it will output a suitable LinkedIn post, as well as giving you a preview of what that would look like in a LinkedIn style. So that's where a lot of my time has been going. I've been pushing through a lot of friction just because it's an area I'm slowly learning more and more. About a year ago, I didn't even know how to code. So the fact that we're here is kind of crazy. But a lot of it has just been developing, okay, how do I learn more about DevOps and how do I ship this product to best, but also how do I build this product? Okay, I'm getting errors on my API calls to my Flask app. How do I figure that out, especially when I'm a finance major? That's where I've been pushing through a lot of friction lately, and that's what a lot of my work entails. Also, we've been hopping on sales calls with VCs. The people that we're trying to provide that service through these products that we're using, that's only the ones that enable us to provide a better service. So a lot of it has just been hopping on sales calls, developing the product, delivering better services.
Interviewer
Out of the whole maybe day or just in general, what do you believe, like, your unique ability is?
Austin Kennedy
I just, like, don't feel a need to stop. I only stop because I need to sleep. I think it's just that ability to just push through friction. I don't really have an off button. And that sounds self aggrandizing, but like, at least lately I have not had an off button. And that's what I think my superpower has been lately.
Interviewer
And this kind of founder journey that you're building, this entire, entire product, entire company. What's something that's been really hard recently? So anything really tough circumstance that's. Maybe you're still not even getting over that obstacle or maybe you just recently. Recently did.
Austin Kennedy
Just closing clients. I think that's something that once we get our first sale, that will do a lot. But just getting your first client's always the hardest. And just figuring that out, that's navigating a process. I mean, we have never really done B2B sales. So just navigating the B2B sales process and figuring it out.
Interviewer
What does this B2B sales process feel like?
Austin Kennedy
At least on the B2B side, it's kind of annoying because you're not really talking to the decision maker or there's three decision makers that. Okay, I think my audience coming through here now.
Interviewer
Can you hear it?
Austin Kennedy
Okay.
Interviewer
Can I hear.
Austin Kennedy
Can't hear me.
Interviewer
Very weird. You're still on your mic.
Austin Kennedy
Wait, can you. Are you sure?
Interviewer
No, it's because you said in the initial call using your headphones.
Austin Kennedy
Okay, I'm good. Well, we need to be sales. It's just a lot harder because the sales cycles just take longer if we're on, like we can't be on one call and close them or it's very unlikely. So just being on these calls, understanding that the first call may not be. May not work, but okay, we're working towards the second one. We're working towards the third one. And understand that the process takes a little bit longer and you have to consistently give value.
Interviewer
Yep, I like that. Give me, give me some messages that you want to share with the world. Some Austin kind of mindset that kind of needs to be taught to other. Other folks.
Austin Kennedy
One I like is just me being the product of my work more than the work is a product of me. So like when these sales calls occur, maybe they, maybe we don't close, but that's okay because you got a little bit better at sales. And just viewing myself as a video game character almost and having all these business attributes upgrade over time, when I do take those sales calls, it's not about closing, it's about upgrading the skills. And then as those attributes get higher and higher across all domains. It's like, oh my God. All of a sudden I understand everything pretty well at business. And then everything just becomes asymmetric. You could just accomplish all sales come quicker. Everything just comes quicker. You build product faster. That would be my big philosophy. It's just the work. Well, that's a hormozy quote. But the work works on me more than I work on it.
Interviewer
What's something that's like wrong with the.
Austin Kennedy
Content industry right now? Okay, this actually would be a good post. Too many people are living in like the two to three years ago strategy which is talking about tips and tricks. But now everything's transitioned. Everyone's tired of that. The content that's more valuable is here is a storytelling. It's this happened to me three months ago. I did this, but now I'm doing that. That's the type of content that's just doing better as well as just raw thoughts depending on the platform. But it's not about if how to scale your business in three steps and then giving three steps. That's not what works anymore. It's three months ago I quit my job. It was hard and just being authentic. And that's the type of. After so many years of shallow content people craven authentic content more than ever. And I think that's something that we're seeing now. But a lot of people on the creator side don't understand. Love it.
Interviewer
Give me a second. What's. What's like a. The kind of the content world. Is there something that's like mainstream that is simply overrated? Um, I'm gonna leave my question at that.
Austin Kennedy
But also side note, side note, it's good how simple these questions are. View around like I hate when people are like, they pile on like two or three in the same one. Like it's so hard to answer those. But I'm. I'm just saying like sort of feedback.
Interviewer
Yeah, I'm kind of starting skill for this. At least for me to be able to lean in like it's going to be a little free for all on my part to like understand this person and then be able to lean in a little bit to more like okay, what are they? What industry are they in? Hopefully I can do some research prior like lean into their story, lean into their past and then lean into this current week and then also lean into like what I just looked up is contrarian perspectives on content. Someone in the content industry in order to get contrarian perspectives. What questions should I ask and cause I think that's like how some people want to be positioning themselves and how do you get more traction? Sorry. So like a control, like what is. What is something that's like completely overrated right now in the content industry?
Austin Kennedy
I, I wanted to give something else, but I just think it goes back to my last answer. Man, it's just like authentic authenticity sells. It's not about as much about making yourself seem like a. You don't need this LinkedIn bio with like eight different titles. Like that doesn't work anymore. Like people sniff that out immediately. It feels shallow nowadays. It's just about being yourself and showing all facets of yourself on social media. Not play.
Interviewer
So what, what. Yeah, what, what style right now is then overrated?
Austin Kennedy
People try to just play one.
Interviewer
What's the common norm of let's say copywriter?
Austin Kennedy
And that's all you see from them. And that doesn't work because people don't. There's so many copywriters out there. People want to know you for you. And if you're. What people like is a basketball player who's also good at copywriting and also gives a TED Talk, like that's the people like those personalities because they're one of one. If you're just a copywriter, you're one of a thousand.
Interviewer
Can anyone, can anyone be one of one?
Austin Kennedy
Everybody is. Right.
Interviewer
Elaborate. Elaborate on everybody being one of one. How do I package myself as one of a kind rather than the common, the common norm of like I guess being. Being with society mainstream. Yeah, you were touching on it right there.
Austin Kennedy
I mean, I think everybody has these little weird interests and you just gotta lean into them for me. And also people just like do like little weird things that make you different. Like for example, like me donating plasma, like that's a cool little thing about me. And I try to lean into that and tell that story sometimes. Or what's another. The door to door sales is also another weird random thing, but also the media channel or the shortcoming news, that's also another weird thing. And I think it's. If you want to be one of one, you have to do one of one things. You don't just do these things that then end up within a role that you want to become, but you just see something that's interesting and you just do it. And then over time you can say you're one of one. Because there's not that many people that have all the same life experiences.
Interviewer
Give me more on that, on that, that plasma story.
Austin Kennedy
I'm curious.
Interviewer
Walk me through how that all kind of Inspired.
Austin Kennedy
So it's the spring of my sophomore year. I look at my bank account and I'm like, I am broke. And this is not I'm broke, but I have like 10k. This is. I'm broke and I have less than $100 to my name. And I'm like, oh, I gotta, I gotta pay for my team, man. I gotta pay for my subscriptions that help me run my clipping, for my, for my short form videos. And I also need to pay for this Adobe extension. And I'm like, I just don't have money. And I didn't want to get a real job because I just didn't want to do that. I didn't want to have to get my hours anywhere, but I still needed to pay for it. And I see us, I've heard, I heard about it before. So I drive over to the local plasma center, walk in, I'm like, how do we, how do we do this three hour orientation, get done with it. Donate plasma. Look at my arm. They've got this thing hooked up into my vein and I just start watching the OVAN clips and that's how that went down. And then I've done, I did it about eight times and then it covered me for a few months. But once I, once I ended up getting in a position where I was making a little bit of money from caddying as well as some other work that I was doing, I was like, okay, I don't need to donate my bodily fluids anymore. But even just being in the plasma center, pretty humble that, you know, donating my own fluids to make ends meet. Yeah, they really made me want to not work because I could feel that I would just get drained after donating. But I told myself that I will do this until I start making more. And that kind of lit a fire under my ass to work harder.
Interviewer
Love it. Which would you say? Damn. It's not really a great question. Which audience demographic? Nah, never mind.
Austin Kennedy
It'll also be easier because you'll have questions.
Interviewer
Ready for the call. Totally. That interesting question is ready for the call. I'll probably use similar thing right here to look up more on the fly. And I'll also just want them to literally like how I feel like I'm going to navigate. This conversation is hopping on this call, saying this is where you can just literally talk for 30 or 40 minutes and mainly it's all on you. Be unique, be weird, be contrarian, be detail oriented. Don't give me. And literally just kind of telling them to kind of Let it, let it loose and explain their life and this is their time to yap and just I can be like a soundboard almost. And I think that's really how I want to illustrate it. So I'm going to ask, like, I might even ask the same question over and over because I want to know more stories, more insights, break on your past week. That's kind of how I'm thinking so far. At least initialize it. Do you believe right now there's like, which, which content platform do you think is at risk, or not even at risk, but maybe able to be overtaken is maybe a little vulnerable right now?
Austin Kennedy
Obviously that's a very, that's a very obvious take just because TikTok, who knows what's going to occur. But I also think that when it comes to good content on Instagram, there's definitely a shortage because it's so tethered to who we feel like we are that we don't want to post yet. Like TikTok, everybody's comfortable with posting TikToks because it seems like the Wild west doesn't seem as like tethered to you, you know, But Instagram, I don't really know that many people that post reels and consequently there's just a huge opportunity there for the people that actually do. So I think Instagram, when it comes to reels and posting that authentic content that I was talking about, if you're really documenting your journey on Instagram, it's like, oh my God, like this person's real and people really latch onto that. So Instagram is definitely one. Another one I would say is LinkedIn. There is a shortage of good content. So many people are just posting these thin blurbs about their thoughts on AI that can just be literally their thoughts on anything, which can be outputted by GBT and used by anybody. And there's just not a lot of substance there. So if you tell a story and you are authentic on LinkedIn, there is so much there. And I think that's something that we're seeing in growing this agency or in growing this, in working with clients that are utilizing LinkedIn the right way, I think there's a great opportunity there.
Interviewer
Totally. What's kind of like a behind the scenes strategy or secret sauce that you might use with certain content and maybe how you're able to gain more traction. Double engagement. Is there anything that's kind of been, at least to you, proven with your strategy? I know we talked about stories and being unique in kind of two manners, but how do you think if you were unique even over the past two posts, what's making more traction emerge?
Austin Kennedy
I would, I'd say one secret sauce that you can implement. This is going to sound so obvious, but find ways to give value to your audience. I go through my LinkedIn feed a lot and I'll see that this person just built this AI agent that helps scrape biotech investors, for example. And as a result all of these biotech founders are commenting under the post that they're interested in getting access to that list because why would they not? It's free and it's value that's being provided. And I think if you really want to grow, identify the types of people that you want to provide value to understand their problems and then provide value with whatever skill set that you have. So whether that's building an AI agent that can then scrape that list, maybe it's manually doing it yourself. There's so many ways that you can provide value if you understand the problems that your audience is facing and provide a solution for that.
Interviewer
Do you like a. Not a step by step process, but like a detailed. Yeah, kind of like a step by step. And how I as like an average person should be providing value? Should I be reading sort of book and then, and then, and then you utilizing that knowledge to then apply that to someone? Should I be sourcing them some sort of critical solution for them to have? Like how should I go about in the content world providing value to my audience?
Austin Kennedy
At least on the content side of things, which is one to many. It's a lot easier to provide value on a one to one level because that's just a lot easier to understand what someone's problems are and then provide solutions. But on a one to many level, find out what tasks they're all doing. Like for example, some biotech founders maybe. I'm going to take an example that I maybe know more about. Okay. For example, VCs, if you want to appeal to VCs, there's some tasks that VCs are doing in terms of making content. For example, other VCs may not be doing that right. So if you want to be valuable to all of them and solve a problem they all deal with, find out a problem that every single VC has or yeah, which is deal flow. All of them will never turn down deals because that's core to what they do. Everything else is window dressing. Content was only an indirect help to deal flow. But if you could understand that, hey, deal flow is what they really want and that's the core problem that they can. That can be solved for them. Maybe it's building an agent that scrapes founders off of a given sector, and then you're like, hey, like, this could be interesting for whatever. VCs is maybe a little bit different because it's an entity, but it's like, hey, hey, all partners. Would you let this agent that helps you scrape all of the founders in your given area as well as that are. That just came out of stealth or something. There's a. There's a lot of tools that can be made that can help solve that core problem.
Interviewer
Awesome. There are like 30. 30 minutes. That's enough. But.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah, this will be cool. Right afterwards, I'll try to turn this into content pieces.
Interviewer
Yeah. I'm curious if, like, this subpar conversation. I also have to hope that they're an interesting person and can, like, drive a lot of this, or am I gonna have to, like, suck it out of them? Because the more. The more they talk, the better, you know? All right, my last one.
Austin Kennedy
But, like, the other thing is, even the stuff that I don't like, obviously my thoughts aren't that clear when I'm speaking them out loud, but they can easily be packaged to make them sound clear. Like the post generation.
Interviewer
Right, right, right, right. That's true. And let's go with, like. See, there's one more interesting question that's kind of on this content side of things. Let's go with. If you could completely delete one style of content from the media on any given platform, from LinkedIn to X to Instagram, what kind of style would you kind of wipe from the Internet?
Austin Kennedy
I hate those. I hate those. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Interviewer
I kind of like where there's a.
Austin Kennedy
Podcast clip on the top and then subway servers at the bottom. That stuff annoys me so much, even though it's so engaging, because there's just so many dopamine hits that are occurring. It just reminds me of how screwed so many of our. What? Yeah. Oh, or yeah, when people have thumbnails where their mouth is open, it's just. Yeah, but that's YouTube videos. I'm more referring to YouTube videos, but I would say content that is just deceitful because there's a line between funnel hacking and packaging your content to get more views, but having a great product. And there's a difference in between that and packaging your shitty product in a way that makes it look like it's something that it's not. So it really just comes down to how good the video is. If there's clickbait, and I fall for it. And then there's nothing to do with the video. But the video is amazing. You know, that's fine. But if it's just a terrible video, then that has nothing to do with the thumbnail. Then it's like, oh, my God, this is just annoying as far. So that would be my biggest thing. Yeah. Also just what we can do, too, is you can go. The call doesn't need to be a certain amount of time, but we could sit down and then have content pieces that we want to make. So we know that one that will be really good is, hey. Or like, this is the biggest problem this founder is dealing with. And then we go into that question for, like, five minutes with them. Because we also could just go in and then have, like, four really good questions that take, like, 15 minutes, and that's all we need, you know, so even, like, the time.
Interviewer
Mm, totally.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah.
Interviewer
It's not necessarily. I can be counting content pieces in my own.
Austin Kennedy
And then we'll get a good idea of the types of content pieces that do well. Because every content piece ultimately just answers a question or tells a story.
Interviewer
Yeah, it's always some sort of, like, takeaway. I learned this through a story. Or I'm going to directly tell you this because it's important. Or the other.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah, because, like, for example, with this one, there's probably, like, you probably had, like, 12 questions or 12. This will probably end up getting filtered into 12 chunks that could be made, like, dim posts just off of, like, purely Q and A. But realistically, we probably could have only done, like, four or five.
Interviewer
What do you mean? I think there are about, like, six, like, four to six really solid LinkedIn posts.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah, that's like a month and a half. I do once a week for 30 minutes.
Interviewer
But, yeah, I think these people should be posting on X. Like, I mean, but other day also.
Austin Kennedy
Like.
Interviewer
LinkedIn, three and a half days.
Austin Kennedy
The other thing that I'm working on next is so, like, the LinkedIn is, like, gold. I think at this point, like, I understand if I make good LinkedIn posts, but I don't necessarily. I still need to get the Twitter stuff down and that I'm gonna, like, have it. I mean, I kind of know what I'm doing, but not enough to, like, really feel confident with it. So I'm just gonna have Jay. I'm gonna Show Jay this LinkedIn app, and I'll be like, hey, bro, I'll give this to you for free if you, like, help me. If you help me, like, make sure my Twitter stuff is so. Yeah.
Interviewer
Cool.
Austin Kennedy
Yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah. So we definitely could do that for Ezra. Yeah, we can cook up some posts.
Interviewer
Yeah. She said there's a recent. There's a recent video.
