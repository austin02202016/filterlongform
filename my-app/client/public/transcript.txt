I think the most important thing if you're in your 20s is to be 20 and not worry about, oh, my God, this guy's so successful. Do you know what the average age of a millionaire is in this country? Alexa, what's the average age of a millionaire in the United States? I think it's 55. The average age of a millionaire is 57.
The average age of a millionaire Is 57. So be patient. Be patient.
I hate when people thinking about everybody else, they see on Instagram and TikTok with fancy cars and think that, like how this people be patient. That's their story. Good for them.
